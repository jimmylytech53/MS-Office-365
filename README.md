## Overview

This project documents a hands-on Microsoft 365 administration lab designed to simulate common tasks performed by Help Desk, IT Support, and Microsoft 365 administrators.

The lab demonstrates practical experience with Microsoft Entra ID, Exchange Online, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, user and group administration, licensing, identity security, and common help-desk scenarios.

# What I Learned

This lab gave me hands-on experience administering a Microsoft 365 environment from both an administrator and end-user perspective. I learned how Microsoft Entra ID, Exchange Online, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, and the Microsoft 365 Admin Center work together to support users across an organization.

One of the most important lessons was understanding the relationship between **identity, licensing, permissions, and service access**. A user account existing in Microsoft 365 does not automatically mean that the user has access to every service. Licenses, group membership, roles, mailbox permissions, Teams membership, and SharePoint permissions can all affect what a user is able to access.

I also gained experience with the **user lifecycle**, including creating accounts, configuring users, resetting passwords, assigning licenses, modifying access, and securely offboarding users. The offboarding scenario was particularly useful because it combined several administrative responsibilities, including blocking authentication, preserving mailbox data, delegating access, configuring automatic replies, releasing licenses, and removing the account.

Working with **Exchange Online** helped me understand the differences between individual mailboxes, shared mailboxes, and distribution lists. I also practiced mailbox delegation and automatic reply configuration.

Through **Microsoft Teams and SharePoint Online**, I learned how groups and permissions affect collaboration. Testing SharePoint with users who had different access levels demonstrated why proper permissions and group membership are important for protecting department-specific information.

The troubleshooting scenarios reinforced a structured help-desk approach:

**Identify the issue → Investigate the configuration → Determine the cause → Implement a solution → Verify the resolution**

Overall, this project improved my confidence navigating Microsoft 365 administration tools and gave me practical experience with many of the tasks performed in Help Desk, IT Support, and junior Microsoft 365 administration roles.
